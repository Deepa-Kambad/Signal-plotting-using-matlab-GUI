# Signal-plotting-using-matlab-GUI
I have plotted 4 types of signals such as sine, square, triangular  and composite signal by using MATLAB GUI 
sine signal:sine function from MATLAB
square signal:Square function
tringualar signal:sawtooth function
composite signal:adittion of signals
I have written specific code for every signal in editor window.
I plotted this 4 signals on GUI window
I have used exit button to exit from the GUI window
I have used MATHLAB 2016 a versionto get the results.
